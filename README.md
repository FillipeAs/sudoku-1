## Simple SUDOKU

College exercise to practice C functions, pointer and file creation and manipulation.
This is a simple "generator" of a 9x9 matrix for sudoku game.

The idea is that I already have a ready and steady 9x9 sudoku matrix, using some functions it's possible to shuffle this matrix. :)

## Simple Interface
I created a very simple interface for user interaction.
